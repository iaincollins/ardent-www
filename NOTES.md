Not quite sure about "unnecessary" features being removed, as I'm not part of the dev team, but the discord mentions many features requested by the community that may or may not be implemented in the final build.

From Vanu4Life in the discord server:

This is a collation of responses I've received from the reddit post earlier, and opinions of some friends I have asked. Feel free to add to it but please keep it in list format, any discussion on specific points should be done in a thread so as not to clutter the list itself. None of these are "must haves," but are just what people have found value in, so we can go through them and decide what to implement and what to leave out. The ones in bold are things I think we should definitely implement.

-- Current UI

-- Mobile access/responsive UI

-- Automatically update CMDR locations/ships/etc. to fill out forms (similar to what Inara does, possibly through Frontier's API/SSO/whatever they use?)

-- Odyssey info (e.g. engineered on-foot suits/weapons) - not sure if possible but worth looking into

-- Maps with POIs, heatmaps of player activity/discoveries. pretty sure other tools already do this but I'm leaving it here anyway

-- Statistics, charts and graphs (e.g. distribution of ELWs across different types of stars)

-- Route plotting capabilities with filters, e.g. setting a start (and possibly end) location, and then creating a route that efficiently maximises the number of systems with (for example) ELWs that you come across

-- TRADING - all the trading functionality from original EDDB

-- Exploration and material gathering locations - we could potentially add these manually, as in my experience these are primarily shared through anecdotes and spreadsheets, altho I think Inara may already do this

-- Permanent links for searches/forms - I guess we could do this by structuring it so that the url includes the relevant query parameters and users can just copy-paste or bookmark the url

There is an ideas forum in the discord server for community members to request features (which is where the above is posted), though of course everything is up to the actual devs and is subject to change. If you are in any way concerned about what may be removed, let us know in the server, make some suggestions, whatever works best.
